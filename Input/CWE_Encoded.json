Untrusted data enters a web application, typically from a web request. 2. The web application dynamically generates a web page that contains this untrusted data. 3. During page generation, the application does not prevent the data from containing content that is executable by a web browser, such as JavaScript, HTML tags, HTML attributes, mouse events, Flash, ActiveX, etc. 4. A victim visits the generated web page through a web browser, which contains malicious script that was injected using the untrusted data. 5. Since the script comes from a web page that was sent by the web server, the victim's web browser executes the malicious script in the context of the web server's domain. 6. This effectively violates the intention of the web browser's same-origin policy, which states that scripts in one domain should not be able to access resources or run code in a different domain. There are three main kinds of XSS: Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site. After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the content is executed by the victim's browser. Type 2: Stored XSS (or Persistent) - The application stores dangerous data in a database, message forum, visitor log, or other trusted data store. At a later time, the dangerous data is subsequently read back into the application and included in dynamic content. From an attacker's perspective, the optimal place to inject malicious content is in an area that is displayed to either many users or particularly interesting users. Interesting users typically have elevated privileges in the application or interact with sensitive data that is valuable to the attacker. If one of these users executes malicious content, the attacker may be able to perform privileged operations on behalf of the user or gain access to sensitive data belonging to the user. For example, the attacker might inject XSS into a log message, which might not be handled properly when an administrator views the logs. Type 0: DOM-Based XSS - In DOM-based XSS, the client performs the injection of XSS into the page; in the other types, the server performs the injection. DOM-based XSS generally involves server-controlled, trusted script that is sent to the client, such as Javascript that performs sanity checks on a form before the user submits it. If the server-supplied script processes user-supplied data and then injects it back into the web page (such as with dynamic HTML), then DOM-based XSS is possible. Once the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities. The attacker could transfer private information, such as cookies that may include session information, from the victim's machine to the attacker. The attacker could send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim, which could be especially dangerous to the site if the victim has administrator privileges to manage that site. Phishing attacks could be used to emulate trusted web sites and trick the victim into entering a password, allowing the attacker to compromise the victim's account on that web site. Finally, the script could exploit a vulnerability in the web browser itself possibly taking over the victim's machine, sometimes referred to as drive-by hacking. In many cases, the attack can be launched without the victim even being aware of it. Even with careful users, attackers frequently use a variety of methods to encode the malicious portion of the attack, such as URL encoding or Unicode, so the request looks less suspicious.\",\r\n            \"related_weaknesses\": { \r\n                \"related_weakness\":[{\r\n                    \"NATURE\":\"ChildOf\",\r\n                    \"CWE ID\":\"74\",\r\n                    \"VIEW ID\":\"1000\",\r\n                    \"ORDINAL\":\"Primary\"\r\n                },{\r\n                    \"NATURE\":\"ChildOf\",\r\n                    \"CWE ID\":\"74\",\r\n                    \"VIEW ID\":\"1003\",\r\n                    \"ORDINAL\":\"Primary\"\r\n                },{\r\n                    \"NATURE \":\"CanPrecede\",\r\n                    \"CWE ID\":\"494\",\r\n                    \"VIEW ID\":\"1000\",\r\n                    \"ORDINAL\":\"\"\r\n                },{\r\n                    \"NATURE\":\"PeerOf\",\r\n                    \"CWE ID\":\"352\",\r\n                    \"VIEW ID\":\"1000\",\r\n                    \"ORDINAL\":\"\"\r\n            }]},\r\n            \"weakness_ordinalities\": {\r\n                \"weakness_ordinality\": {\r\n                    \"ORDINALITY\":\"Resultant\",\r\n                    \"DESCRIPTION\":\"\"\r\n            }},\r\n            \"applicable_platforms\": {\r\n                \"applicable_platform\": {\r\n                    \"Language\": {\r\n                        \"Class\": \"Language-Independent\",\r\n                        \"Prevalence\": \"Undetermined\"\r\n                    },\r\n                    \"Technology\": {\r\n                        \"Class\": \"Web Based\",\r\n                        \"Prevalence\": \"Often\"\r\n            }}},\r\n            \"background_details\": {\r\n                \"background_detail\": \"Same Origin Policy The same origin policy states that browsers should limit the resources accessible to scripts running on a given web site, or origin, to the resources associated with that web site on the client-side, and not the client-side resources of any other sites or origins.

Use an accept known good input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, boat may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as red or blue. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When dynamically constructing web pages, use stringent whitelists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. All input should be validated and cleansed, not just parameters that the user is supposed to specify, but all data in the request, including hidden fields, cookies, headers, the URL itself, and so forth. A common mistake that leads to continuing XSS vulnerabilities is to validate only fields that are expected to be redisplayed by the site. It is common to see data from the request that is reflected by the application server or the application that the development team did not anticipate. Also, a field that is not currently reflected may be used by a future developer. Therefore, validating ALL parts of the HTTP request is recommended. Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing XSS, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent XSS, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, in a chat application, the heart emoticon (<3) would likely pass the validation step, since it is commonly used. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the web page because it contains the < character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the < might reduce the risk of XSS, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the emoticon would not be recorded. This might seem to be a minor inconvenience, but it would be more important in a mathematical forum that wants to represent inequalities. Even if you make a mistake in your validation (such as forgetting one out of 100 input fields), appropriate encoding is still likely to protect you from injection-based attacks. As long as it is not done in isolation, input validation is still a useful technique, since it may significantly reduce your attack surface, allow you to detect some attacks, and provide other security benefits that proper encoding does not address. Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application. This will help protect the application even if a component is reused or moved elsewhere.\",\r\n                    \"EFFECTIVENESS\":\"\",\r\n                    \"Note\":\"\"\r\n                },{\r\n                    \"PHASE\":\"Architecture and Design\",\r\n                    \"STRATEGY\":\"Enforcement by Conversion\",\r\n                    \"DESCRIPTION\":\"When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\",\r\n                    \"EFFECTIVENESS\":\"\",\r\n                    \"Note\":\"\"\r\n                },{\r\n                    \"PHASE\":\"Operation\",\r\n                    \"STRATEGY\":\"Firewall\",\r\n                    \"DESCRIPTION\":\"Use an application firewall that can detect attacks against this weakness.

If some special characters are still needed, such as white space, wrap each argument in quotes after the escaping\/filtering step. Be careful of argument injection (CWE-88). Instead of building a new implementation, such features may be available in the database or programming language.

Use an 'accept known good' input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, 'boat' may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as 'red' or 'blue.' Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. When constructing SQL query strings, use stringent allowlists that limit the character set based on the expected value of the parameter in the request. This will indirectly limit the scope of an attack, but this technique is less important than proper output encoding and escaping. Note that proper output encoding, escaping, and quoting is the most effective solution for preventing SQL injection, although input validation may provide some defense-in-depth. This is because it effectively limits what will appear in output. Input validation will not always prevent SQL injection, especially if you are required to support free-form text fields that could contain arbitrary characters. For example, the name 'O'Reilly' would likely pass the validation step, since it is a common last name in the English language. However, it cannot be directly inserted into the database because it contains the ''' apostrophe character, which would need to be escaped or otherwise handled. In this case, stripping the apostrophe might reduce the risk of SQL injection, but it would produce incorrect behavior because the wrong name would be recorded. When feasible, it may be safest to disallow meta-characters entirely, instead of escaping them. This will provide some defense in depth. After the data is entered into the database, later processes may neglect to escape meta-characters before use, and you may not have control over those processes.\",\r\n                    \"EFFECTIVENESS\": \"\",\r\n                    \"Note\":\"\"\r\n                },{\r\n                    \"PHASE\": \"Architecture and Design\",\r\n                    \"STRATEGY\": \"Enforcement by Conversion\",\r\n                    \"DESCRIPTION\": \"When the set of acceptable objects, such as filenames or URLs, is limited or known, create a mapping from a set of fixed input values (such as numeric IDs) to the actual filenames or URLs, and reject all other inputs.\",\r\n                    \"EFFECTIVENESS\": \"\",\r\n                    \"Note\":\"\"\r\n                },{ \r\n                    \"PHASE\": \"Implementation\",\r\n                    \"STRATEGY\": \"\",\r\n                    \"DESCRIPTION\": \"Ensure that error messages only contain minimal details that are useful to the intended audience and no one else.

Use an 'accept known good' input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, 'boat' may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as 'red' or 'blue.' Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright. To reduce the likelihood of code injection, use stringent allowlists that limit which constructs are allowed. If you are dynamically constructing code that invokes a function, then verifying that the input is alphanumeric might be insufficient. An attacker might still be able to reference a dangerous function that you did not intend to allow, such as system(), exec(), or exit().\"\r\n                },{\r\n                    \"Phase\": \"Testing\",\r\n                    \"Strategy\": \"\",\r\n                    \"Description\": \"Use automated static analysis tools that target this type of weakness.

Enforcement: the mechanism contains errors that prevent it from properly enforcing the specified access control requirements (e.g., allowing the user to specify their own privileges, or allowing a syntactically-incorrect ACL to produce insecure settings).
